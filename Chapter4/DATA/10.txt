Cloning is mutually advancement in biotechnology and with adequate regulations imposed, it will be benefit human races.
From the technical aspect, two perfectly identical human is impossible. The cloning procedure only copies the genetic information of a human, but it cannot replicate the environment and incidents one has experienced. Post-utero environment is determinant either on epigenomes or mental issues, for it will change the gene expression and shape one’s thought. Meanwhile, lots of gene loci haven’t been well interpreted and researchers mainly target pathogenic gene to find cure from the root. It is unnecessary to dream that a ‘perfect Aryanne’ will be produced by the Third Reich fascists. At last, any alterations in gene sequence increase the risk of mutation. For mutation is principally random, it will inevitably change the appearance of the newly cloned human.
Given that the technology is still marching to maturity by now, there may be less ethical concerns. As gene-related research mainly focus on fatal diseases, the current application is to be therapeutic only. In addition, the true customers behind cloning are unconceivable couples and those who carry genetic diseases, not politicians with crazy ideas, as it is economically unfavourable. Updates in technology will enhance the potential of gene related therapies on traditional medicine resistant patients and bring new hope to them.
With caution and rationality, cloning marks a new era of biological science. It gifts us the ability to change nature in a certain scale. I genuinely believe that it will positively impact on lives of future human.
