I would support the position that cloning for the simple benefit for humans, like food and supply, shall he allowed, white by no means should human cloning be permitted
Firstly, the certain procedure of human cloning is not yet defined as safe or heath beneficial, for the truly exact process is not yet scientifically understood. We don’t know what a subtal or minute difference during cloning could lead to, which makes human cloning a uncertainty in the clone product’s life expectation, and finally end in the debate of the legal right of human clones.
Secondly, as long as the method were to allowed for the public, tremendous moral doubts would occur, as simply the relation between the clone product and the original being could be impossible to define For example, when the new clone was born, the original human being wouldn’t be allowed to decide the relation between the two humans by his own tempt, and the death of the 2-human may lead to problems in law of heritage.
 In addition, I permanently disagree with human cloning for various problems it might lead to. As everything is not yet certain, we shall base our position in the government's (or the CEO’s) demand.
