From my perspective, cloning should be allowed for research about treating diseases, but human cloning should not be allowed.
First, human cloning is not proper in moral aspect. Once a human is cloned, he will own all the organs and the ability of thinking just identical as an individual. What should be considered is that how will he be treated in the society and whether he owns the rights of human. For example, who will take care of his wring? What action should be taken when the provider of the embryo regretted the choice? The clone comes to the world without any choice, how is he able to live? These are all questions that should be concerned.
Second, according to the previous example of Dolly the sheep. It died not long after it was cloned because of some serious disease. We can not guarantee this kind of consequence not to happen again, and it’s also unfair for the human clone. If it’s highly risky and morally against human equivalence, what’s the point to do this？
Thus,  I believe cloning should only be allowed for scientific researches. But human cloning shouldn’t be done.
