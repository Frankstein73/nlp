I'm for the cloning of plants, animals and human beings. As it is acknowledged that plants and animal clones can do no harm, these should be definitely allowed in order to serve the human race and its development. And (speuhly?) of humans, while some experts say that moral issues are to be considered, other evidence have shown us that human clones have a lot of genetic flaws. This means that they are incapable of cloning themselves and they shouldn’t be regarded as humane due to their short lives and relatively lower than standard IQ. I propose that they can be used as slaves to benefit humans in production. Once we have artificial cells and wombs for mass clone production, I suggest everyone get two to three clones of themselves to serve them. Legislations may be under going on clone's rights as slaves and the mass number of clones a person can have. Just as ancient Greece thrived on slavery, we shall thrive again on slavery of clones who are sub-humans, thus giving a more equal and diverse world for real humans like us.
