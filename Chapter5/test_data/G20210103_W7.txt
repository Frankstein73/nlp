Preparing our students for the AI era Dear teachers in SFLS SFLS is going to witness its 60th birthday, and I have stayed in the school for 6 years. I myself have seen changes in the school: our classroom became more electronic, building renovated, blackboards replaced with screen ...... all these reflect the chance in teaching methods in this school. However, we are now facing probably the biggest choice in teaching method ever: whether we should allow, or even encourage, students to use AI tools in the writing classes? The invention of ChatGPTs marked a beginning of a new AI revolution where the AI can assist human in almost every field in our society. In fact, program developers, game designers, artists and even the national defence department have started to use AI in their work. As teachers, our ultimate principle is to help students achieving a more successful future and better persue their dreams. Thus, what educators need to do is to give students the knowledge they need to be competitive in the future society. That is, in this case, the ability to write with aids from AI. We notonly need to allow students to use AI, but also we need to encourage them to use it, helping them to use AI tools well. It is a challenging task, but that's what students really need for their future. For students who persue literature as their life goal, we need training in traditional ways, particularly more creative writings, since for professional writers, forming your unique writing styles and having certain levels of knowledge in writing will still be important and can't be replaced by AI. For students presuing science and management, AI tools would be part of their future life and thus should be the focus of their writing classes. The AI era is calling us and we should prepare our students for that.
