Let the talented athletes embrass their fortune In 2022 in China, top athletes could earn as much as 20,000,000  every year. Meanwhile, almost 0.2 billion people earned less than 10000  every year. Is it fair to say that athletes haven't have earned more than they deserve to? Athletes have their own concerns. In the short golden period of their careers, athletes have to prepare enough income for the rest of their lives, when their physical conditions no longer allow them to serve their clubs. In the same time, high incomes is the reason why so many talented young men and wemen decided to devote themselves into sports. Following the same logic, actors, actresses, composers and other artists also earned high income either by their talents or fame. To criticize athletes for their high income means to criticize all artists and social activists as well, for they also don't create any material value. The logic is simple  if someone make their fortune by talents and training, why would we see it as immoral? However, there are indeed some unfairness in the distribution of wealth among athletes. The Chinese national football team has never won a single match, but its teammates are always among the wealthiest athletes in China. Some top athletes have won the Olympic gold medals, but what they got is not enough to buy an apartment in major cities in China. If the football players earn their income not by hardship, then they must be, and should be, accused for money laundering and illegal gamblings. For the good of the country, let those talented athletes embrass their fortune and punish those immoral ones.
