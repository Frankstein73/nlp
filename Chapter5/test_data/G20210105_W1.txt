 As technology improves, the Doly sheep became the first successful example of cloning, it's controversial around the world. Some people are so nervous about the possible ethnic problems behind the tech. However, as far as l am concerned, clonings should not be worried and could bring infinite potential benefits to the development of science in medicine. First of all, cloning can only be useful when it's applied to human beings to treat diseases, and it will cause a decrease in genetic diversity if the technology is applied to plants or animals. Cloning partially equal to asexual reproduction, thus the mutations will be difficult to happen if the individuals in the species have the similar genes(Though there're afterborn mutations happening, this is much lower the ones happening during assortments or crossingovers in meiosis), so the species will have less resistance to the change of outer environment or diseases, and an extinction will be easily induced. Secondly, current medical science has faced numerous victories so far in the world. One of them is the Inducable Pluripotent Stem Cells (IPS), to which the Nobel Prize was presented in the year 2006, which solved the problems of damaged skin cells of large areas and repaired thousands of patients' visual cells. Though a higher differentiable Stem Cells are more likely to induce cancer cells by mistake. It furthermore verify the necessity to make more scientific investigation into the field. In conclusion, the careful use and reasonable development of the practice will benefit people will little risk and danger.
