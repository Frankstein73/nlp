The birth of Dolly the sheep shocked the world in 1996. Yet, 30 years after the great discovery, few progresses have been made in applying the cloning technology in various fields where it should have bright future. This is partly because of people's conservative attitudes towards it. However, as time flies, it is time for us to restart researches in animal cloning to support medical and food industries. The cloning technology has shown its promising future in food industries. The first artificial steak, made by an US cooperation, was worth 35,000 at that time. Now artificial steaks, together with other food products based on cloning, has become much cheaper and the cost has been reduced to about 1. These products are quiet popular in today's US, particularly among younger generations. Cloning, too, plays an important role in the medical field. The application of cloned animals would reduce cost for medical experiments, providing more opportunities in the field. Meanwhile, several therapies, repersented by the organ cloning theropy, has brought hope to many patients. Some people might worried about the moral risks of cloning. That might be true in human cloning. But after all, the cloned animals are not much different from those we presumed every day. Then where do the risk come from? In my opinion, with its success in all these fields, cloning would have its golden age in near future.
