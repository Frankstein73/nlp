In my opinion, cloning should be allowed in every beneficial way except cloning humans. There're many advantages in cloning actually.
Firstly, for plants cloning. it will surely benefit the world. Genetic methods taken on plants for fertility have existed for years, and it really has improved the quantity a lot. I bet the cloning tech will perform even better on this field.
Secondly, as for animals, cloning will be a highly useful mans of protecting endangered species. It can even give birth to those extinct species if their gene codes are available.
Lastly, though human cloning is commonly unacceptable, organ cloning is a substitute then. Those sick, we could simply clone a healthy version of his illed organ and replace the illed organ. Thus his disease will persumably ger well.
Al in all, cloning has many benefits for human race. We should accept such cloning for a better world
