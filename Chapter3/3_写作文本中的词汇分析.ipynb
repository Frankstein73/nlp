    "写作研究长期以来一直是英语研究（EFL research, English as Foreign Language research）中的一个重要分支。为了识别写作的潜在发展轨迹及其与学习者其他认知能力（如语言熟练度）之间的关系，已经开发出多种测量方法来识别写作中使用的语言的复杂度。这些测量方法通常被称为语言复杂度指标。  \n",
    "**语言复杂度**被定义为使用更高级的语言形式和功能的能力，这些通常是在第二语言或外语发展的后期获得的（Ellis, 2009; Pallotti, 2015）。语言复杂度长期以来被视为一个多维构念，涵盖了在不同语言层面（即词汇、句法和结构层面）对语言的复杂使用。为了更好地大规模分析这些语言特征，许多研究人员开发了工具来自动化这些分析过程。在本讲中，我们将简要讨论各种语言复杂度指标的测量方法，以及如何自动提取和分析学习者写作中的这些特征。\n"

      "I'm for the cloning of plants, animals and human beings. As it is acknowledged that plants and animal clones can do no harm, these should be definitely allowed in order to serve the human race and its development. And (speuhly?) of humans, while some experts say that moral issues are to be considered, other evidence have shown us that human clones have a lot of genetic flaws. This means that they are incapable of cloning themselves and they shouldn’t be regarded as humane due to their short lives and relatively lower than standard IQ. I propose that they can be used as slaves to benefit humans in production. Once we have artificial cells and wombs for mass clone production, I suggest everyone get two to three clones of themselves to serve them. Legislations may be under going on clone's rights as slaves and the mass number of clones a person can have. Just as ancient Greece thrived on slavery, we shall thrive again on slavery of clones who are sub-humans, thus giving a more equal and diverse world for real humans like us.\n",

      "I'm for the cloning of plants, animals and human beings. As it is acknowledged that plants and animal clones can do no harm, these should be definitely allowed in order to serve the human race and its development. And (speuhly?) of humans, while some experts say that moral issues are to be considered, other evidence have shown us that human clones have a lot of genetic flaws. This means that they are incapable of cloning themselves and they shouldn't be regarded as humane due to their short lives and relatively lower than standard IQ. I propose that they can be used as slaves to benefit humans in production. Once we have artificial cells and wombs for mass clone production, I suggest everyone get two to three clones of themselves to serve them. Legislations may be under going on clone's rights as slaves and the mass number of clones a person can have. Just as ancient Greece thrived on slavery, we shall thrive again on slavery of clones who are sub-humans, thus giving a more equal and diverse world for real humans like us.\n",

The cloning procedure only copies the genetic information of a human, but it cannot replicate the environment and incidents one has experienced. Post-utero environment is determinant either on epigenomes or mental issues, for it will change the gene expression and shape one's thought. Meanwhile, lots of gene loci haven't been well interpreted and researchers mainly target pathogenic gene to find cure from the root. It is unnecessary to dream that a 'perfect Aryanne' will be produced by the Third Reich fascists. At last, any alterations in gene sequence increase the risk of mutation. For mutation is principally random, it will inevitably change the appearance of the newly cloned human.\n",
      "Given that the technology is still marching to maturity by now, there may be less ethical concerns. As gene-related research mainly focus on fatal diseases, the current application is to be therapeutic only. In addition, the true customers behind cloning are unconceivable couples and those who carry genetic diseases, not politicians with crazy ideas, as it is economically unfavourable. Updates in technology will enhance the potential of gene related therapies on traditional medicine resistant patients and bring new hope to them.\n",

As far as I'm concerned, I hold that cloning for solutions of certain diseases can be allowed and legitimated, but human cloning must be forbidden. My reasons are as follows.\n",
      "Above all, clones, as a brand new component of the human society, will face the problem of appropriate social status. As human-like creatures, they are different from human, thus discrimination and biased statements will certainly occur. In addition, such stereotypes are extremely hard to alter through laws. Plus, human cloning lack public advocates. Data obtained from a Gallup poll in 2014 indicates that 83% Americans hold that human cloning is morally wrong. Such low portion of advocates may lead to a lack of patrons, which potentially cumbers, or even ceases developments in the field. Last but not least, cloning technologies may be accessed by people with intentions other than research. For instance, science fictions emphasized the possibility that a cloned army be created by a tyrant, who inteneds to doom the whole universe.

      "I'm for the cloning of plants, animals and human beings. As it is acknowledged that plants and animal clones can do no harm, these should be definitely allowed in order to serve the human race and its development. And (especially?) of humans, while some experts say that moral issues are to be considered, other evidence have shown us that human clones have a lot of genetic flaws. This means that they are incapable of cloning themselves and they shouldn't be regarded as humane due to their short lives and relatively lower than standard IQ. I propose that they can be used as slaves to benefit humans in production. Once we have artificial cells and wombs for mass clone production, I suggest everyone get two to three clones of themselves to serve them. Legislation may be under going on clone's rights as slaves and the mass number of clones a person can have. Just as ancient Greece thrived on slavery, we shall thrive again on slavery of clones who are sub-humans, thus giving a more equal and diverse world for real humans like us.\n",

      "Essay: Cloning is mutually advancement in biotechnology and with adequate regulations imposed, it will be benefit human races.\n",
      "From the technical aspect, two perfectly identical human is impossible. The cloning procedure only copies the genetic information of a human, but it cannot replicate the environment and incidents one has experienced. Post-utero environment is determinant either on epigenomes or mental issues, for it will change the gene expression and shape one's thought. Meanwhile, lots of gene loci haven't been well interpreted and researchers mainly target pathogenic gene to find cure from the root. It is unnecessary to dream that a 'perfect Aryanne' will be produced by the Third Reich fascists. At last, any alterations in gene sequence increase the risk of mutation. For mutation is principally random, it will inevitably change the appearance of the newly cloned human.\n",
      "Given that the technology is still marching to maturity by now, there may be less ethical concerns. As gene-related research mainly focus on fatal diseases, the current application is to be therapeutic only. In addition, the true customers behind cloning are unconceivable couples and those who carry genetic diseases, not politicians with crazy ideas, as it is economically unfavorable. Updates in technology will enhance the potential of gene related therapies on traditional medicine resistant patients and bring new hope to them.\n",

      "Secondly, as for animals, cloning will be a highly useful mans of protecting endangered species. It can even give birth to those extinct species if their gene codes are available.\n",
      "Lastly, though human cloning is commonly unacceptable, organ cloning is a substitute then. Those sick, we could simply clone a healthy version of his ill organ and replace the ill organ. Thus his disease will presumably get well.\n",

      "Firstly, the certain procedure of human cloning is not yet defined as safe or heath beneficial, for the truly exact process is not yet scientifically understood. We don't know what a subtle or minute difference during cloning could lead to, which makes human cloning a uncertainty in the clone product's life expectation, and finally end in the debate of the legal right of human clones.\n",
      "Secondly, as long as the method were to allowed for the public, tremendous moral doubts would occur, as simply the relation between the clone product and the original being could be impossible to define For example, when the new clone was born, the original human being wouldn't be allowed to decide the relation between the two humans by his own tempt, and the death of the 2-human may lead to problems in law of heritage.\n",

The moral limits and feasibility of such field called cloning have triggered a heated debate. As far as I'm concerned, I hold that cloning for solutions of certain diseases can be allowed and legitimated, but human cloning must be forbidden. My reasons are as follows.\n",
      "Above all, clones, as a brand new component of the human society, will face the problem of appropriate social status. As human-like creatures, they are different from human, thus discrimination and biased statements will certainly occur. In addition, such stereotypes are extremely hard to alter through laws. Plus, human cloning lack public advocates. Data obtained from a Gallup poll in 2014 indicates that 83% Americans hold that human cloning is morally wrong. Such low portion of advocates may lead to a lack of patrons, which potentially cumbers, or even ceases developments in the field. Last but not least, cloning technologies may be accessed by people with intentions other than research. For instance, science fictions emphasized the possibility that a cloned army be created by a tyrant, who intends to doom the whole universe. Such intimidating examples may have been exaggerated but they offered valuable insights.\n",

      "Diseases, have always been major cause of death, is an unavoidable issue from ancient world. However, as the technology continues to improve, treating diseases by cloning technology might help to cure decisive diseases effectively like never before. By applying a normal egg of the specific organ, the scientists can get a brand new part of human body and distribute that to patients.\n",
      "However, it's hard to only copy a part of body with the help of the fertility of another creature. If the case turned out to be picking out a particular part of a cloned creature, the problem became severe morally. We clearly don't have the access to deprive an unborn creature's body. In addition to this, the cloning of human bodies is risky which includes potential threats which includes potential threats which will bring pain to the cloned creatures.\n",

    "### 4.3 词汇复杂度(Lexical sophistication)\n",
    "#### 概念\n",
    "词汇复杂度指的是文本中“高级词汇”的使用比例。“高级词汇”既可以指词汇使用的多样性，也可以指复杂词汇的频繁使用。因此，词汇复杂度指标通常使用一个语料库作为基准参照，例如British National Corpus (BNC), Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)；或者更加专业的学术词汇语料库，例如Academic Word List (AWL) (Coxhead, 2000); Academic Formulas List (AFL) (Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010) 。\n",
    "#### 常用指标\n",
    "- BNC word frequency: 文本中词汇在BNC语料库中词频的平均值(Kyle & Crossley, 2015)。其中包括写作语料库和口语语料库两个指标。\n",
    "- Academic word list: 文本中词汇在AWL列表词汇中的频数(Kyle & Crossley, 2015)。\n",
    "#### 指标生成方法\n",
    "Kyle等人在2015年开发了自动化词汇复杂度分析工具(TAALES: Tool for Automatic Analysis of Lexical Sophistication)，并在后续进行了多次升级(Crossley & Kyle, 2018; Kyle et al., 2018)。该工具可以生成一系列词汇复杂度指标，包括频数指标，N元词组指标等。详细介绍参考https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taales.html。下面是代码演示如何使用TAALES生成本节示例文本的BNC Written Frequency AW和Academic Word List ALL指标。"

    "### 4.4 形态复杂度(Morphological complexity)\n",
    "#### 概念\n",
    "形态复杂度可以分为屈折变化复杂度(inflectional complexity)和派生变换复杂度(derivational compelxity):    \n",
    "- 屈折变化复杂度：屈折变化表示一个词与其局部话语语境的关系，这种关系体现在时态、数等方面，而不改变词性或底层含义(Tywoniw & Crossley, 2020)。例如动词时态、语态、情态之间的变化，do变成doing或者done；或者名词性数格的变化，apple变成apples。\n",
    "- 派生变化复杂度：派生形变化改变一个词的语义或句法类别（即改变意义或词性），通过在词的开头（前缀）或结尾（后缀）添加带有意义的单位(Tywoniw & Crossley, 2020)。例如同词根名词，形容词和副词之间的变换，interest变成interesting或者interestingly。\n",
    "#### 常用指标\n",
    "- 屈折变化复杂度指数(Inflectional mean complexity index)：反映屈折变化复杂度的综合指数，具体计算方法参见Brezina & Pallotti (2019)，指数越高，屈折变化越丰富\n",
    "- 派生变化复杂度指数(Derivational mean complexity index)：反映派生变化复杂度的综合指数，具体计算方法参考Brezina & Pallotti (2019)，由Tywoniw & Crossley (2020)开发，指数越高，派生变化越丰富。\n",
    "#### 指标生成方法\n",
    "Tywoniw和Kyle两人在2022年开发了可以生成词汇形态复杂度指标的自动化分析工具(TAMMI: Tool for Automatic Morphological Complexity Measurement)，其中包括一系列词汇和形态复杂度指标，其中包括Inflectional_MCI_10和Derivational_MCI_10。下面是代码演示如何使用TAMMI生成本节示例文本的两个形态复杂度指标。"
