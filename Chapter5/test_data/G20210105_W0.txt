Nowadays, iPad using is becoming more and more popular in China and around the world. Currently, some teachers are taking tablets into classrooms. However, as far as I am concerned, this should be banned for students according to the following elaborations. Firstly, tablets have more than one function, most of which are not related to study, which may otherwise make students distract from the actual circumstances, which is especially hard to control by teachers. Tablets may be a study assistant, but it's also a tool for searching for answers on websites or playing video games, which gradually reduces the time and ability of thinking. Secondly, tablet itself is not beneficial for students even if it's designed for learning. The side effects of tablets have concerned a population of focus from parents and even experts in which they will cause nearsighted disease and radiations for students for long time, an impact on children's health can not be excluded, and will even lead to mutations. Though tablet itself is deigned for good, but human being's use of it may result in bad consequences. There's no need to mention children without selfcontrol. As a conclusion, it's not a good idea that iPads should be used for schoolworks.
