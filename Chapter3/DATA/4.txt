As science and technology develops, the new research, in which identical copies of living creatures are created and produced, has raised much public attention. The moral limits and feasibility of such field called cloning have triggered a heated debate. As far as I'm concerned, I hold that cloning for solutions of certain diseases can be allowed and legitimated, but human cloning must be forbidden. My reasons are as follows.
Above all, clones, as a brand new component of the human society, will face the problem of appropriate social status. As human-like creatures, they are different from human, thus discrimination and biased statements will certainly occur. In addition, such stereotypes are extremely hard to alter through laws. Plus, human cloning lack public advocates. Data obtained from a Gallup poll in 2014 indicates that 83% Americans hold that human cloning is morally wrong. Such low portion of advocates may lead to a lack of patrons, which potentially cumbers, or even ceases developments in the field. Last but not least, cloning technologies may be accessed by people with intentions other than research. For instance, science fictions emphasized the possibility that a cloned army be created by a tyrant, who inteneds to doom the whole universe. Such intimidating examples may have been exaggerated but they offered valuable insights.
In a nutshell we have every reason to believe that human cloning should be banned.
