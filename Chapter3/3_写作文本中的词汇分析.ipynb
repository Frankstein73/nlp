    "写作研究长期以来一直是英语研究（EFL research, English as Foreign Language research）中的一个重要分支。为了识别写作的潜在发展轨迹及其与学习者其他认知能力（如语言熟练度）之间的关系，已经开发出多种测量方法来识别写作中使用的语言的复杂度。这些测量方法通常被称为语言复杂度指标。  \n",
    "**语言复杂度**被定义为使用更高级的语言形式和功能的能力，这些通常是在第二语言或外语发展的后期获得的（Ellis, 2009; Pallotti, 2015）。语言复杂度长期以来被视为一个多维构念，涵盖了在不同语言层面（即词汇、句法和结构层面）对语言的复杂使用。为了更好地大规模分析这些语言特征，许多研究人员开发了工具来自动化这些分析过程。在本讲中，我们将简要讨论各种语言复杂度指标的测量方法，以及如何自动提取和分析学习者写作中的这些特征。\n"

      "From the technical aspect, two perfectly identical human is impossible. The cloning procedure only copies the genetic information of a human, but it cannot replicate the environment and incidents one has experienced. Post-utero environment is determinant either on epigenomes or mental issues, for it will change the gene expression and shape one’s thought. Meanwhile, lots of gene loci haven’t been well interpreted and researchers mainly target pathogenic gene to find cure from the root. It is unnecessary to dream that a ‘perfect Aryanne’ will be produced by the Third Reich fascists. At last, any alterations in gene sequence increase the risk of mutation. For mutation is principally random, it will inevitably change the appearance of the newly cloned human.\n",
      "Given that the technology is still marching to maturity by now, there may be less ethical concerns. As gene-related research mainly focus on fatal diseases, the current application is to be therapeutic only. In addition, the true customers behind cloning are unconceivable couples and those who carry genetic diseases, not politicians with crazy ideas, as it is economically unfavourable. Updates in technology will enhance the potential of gene related therapies on traditional medicine resistant patients and bring new hope to them.\n",
      "With caution and rationality, cloning marks a new era of biological science. It gifts us the ability to change nature in a certain scale. I genuinely believe that it will positively impact on lives of future human.\n",

      "Essay: With scientists‘ joint efforts, the technology of cloning has emerged. Some people consider it as an opportunity while other people held a totally opposite opinion that it will certainly become a threat. Personally, I don't agree with either of them and I think it's Okay to clone animals or plants, but it's a threat when it comes to human beings.\n",
      "Farmers recently have adopted the technology to clone plants. For them, it's fantastic news that crops feature qualities that people like such as juiciness in tomatoes with the help of cloning, Scientists who study animals ever make it to clone the endangered animals to save them and the technology somehow has made up for our damages to their living environments.\n",
      "However, cloning between cloning human beings is never a good idea and should never be allowed. If human beings are cloned, our senses of uniqueness will be destroyed and our lives will be meaningless. Furthermore, if clones of us are used in crimes, results will be awful.\n",
      "To sum up, cloning plants and animals enable us to have a better life, but cloning human beings is absolutely a threat that will potentially do harm to us.\n",

      "Essay: The not so new technology of cloning about which many scientific novels and mories have already discussed, has never failed to arose infinite interest and imaginations. These often are too off-target that they become funny, which, as a result, means cloning is misunderstood. While my opinion is, a clear and scientific understanding of “cloning” is in must, and morally, only human cloning should be banned. \n",
      "What people must understand before deciding the fate of this controversial technology is that the perfect copy-and-pasting of a person is not possible. A person's personality is decided by his experience environment as much as his gene. This means a cloned human cannot represent the state of the original human, both physically and mentally. In such way, without the consciousness of oneself as a cloned organism, a cloned animal can live quite normally, he is a real animal after all, which is the reason why animal cloning is perfectly fine.\n",
      "However, the problems we face with cloned humans are shortened lives and self-consciousness. Just like Dolly the sheep, cloned animals suffer from below-average levels of physical well-being and shortened lifetime. While animals, when being cloned, always serve a certain function. Humans have the right to live independently, which means that deciding their physical health to be bad is unfair. Meanwhile, as cloned humans, almost certainly helped the chance and ability to realize their identity as a cloned organism. They will find it hard to accept feeling that they are just a copy of someone else. It's not the truth, though, but it's certainly morally wrong to make them suffer.\n",

However, as the technology continues to improve, treating diseases by cloning technology might help to cure decisive diseases effectively like never before. By applying a normal egg of the specific organ, the scientists can get a brand new part of human body and distribute that to patients.\n",
      "However, it's hard to only copy a part of body with the help of the fertility of another creature. If the case turned out to be picking out a particular part of a cloned creature, the problem became severe morally. We clearly don't have the access to deprive an unborn creature’s body. In addition to this, the cloning of human bodies is risky which includes potential threats which includes potential threats which will bring pain to the cloned creatures.\n",

      "Diseases, have always been major cause of death, is an unavoidable issue from ancient world. However, as the technology continues to improve, treating diseases by cloning technology might help to cure decisive diseases effectively like never before. By applying a normal egg of the specific organ, the scientists can get a brand new part of human body and distribute that to patients.\n",
      "However, it's hard to only copy a part of body with the help of the fertility of another creature. If the case turned out to be picking out a particular part of a cloned creature, the problem became severe morally. We clearly don't have the access to deprive an unborn creature's body. In addition to this, the cloning of human bodies is risky which includes potential threats which includes potential threats which will bring pain to the cloned creatures.\n",

The moral limits and feasibility of such field called cloning have triggered a heated debate. As far as I'm concerned, I hold that cloning for solutions of certain diseases can be allowed and legitimated, but human cloning must be forbidden. My reasons are as follows.\n",
      "Above all, clones, as a brand new component of the human society, will face the problem of appropriate social status. As human-like creatures, they are different from human, thus discrimination and biased statements will certainly occur. In addition, such stereotypes are extremely hard to alter through laws. Plus, human cloning lack public advocates. Data obtained from a Gallup poll in 2014 indicates that 83% Americans hold that human cloning is morally wrong. Such low portion of advocates may lead to a lack of patrons, which potentially cumbers, or even ceases developments in the field. Last but not least, cloning technologies may be accessed by people with intentions other than research.

      "To begin with, cloning does do some good to economical or scientific development. For instance, when there isn't enough space to grow more crops because of the growing number of citizens, we need to create a more efficient kind of crops to replace the old one.  Also, scientists will be enabled to do more experiments in order to have a better understanding of the theories and conclusions with the technology of cloning, especially in biology and medicines.\n",
      "Besides, it is definitely inappropriate and harmful to clone human beings. The new-born baby is likely to have some unknown diseases or lack of consciousness. Even if he is as healthy as a normal person, he doesn't have parents and personal identity, which is totally different from others. I think it will be extremely difficult for him even just to live an ordinary life, which is extremely unacceptable and upsetting.\n",

What should be considered is that how will he be treated in the society and whether he owns the rights of human. For example, who will take care of his wring?

Once we have artificial cells and wombs for mass clone production, I suggest everyone get two to three clones of themselves to serve them.

      "Essay: Cloning is mutually advancement in biotechnology and with adequate regulations imposed, it will be benefit human races.\n",
      "From the technical aspect, two perfectly identical human is impossible. The cloning procedure only copies the genetic information of a human, but it cannot replicate the environment and incidents one has experienced. Post-utero environment is determinant either on epigenomes or mental issues, for it will change the gene expression and shape one's thought. Meanwhile, lots of gene loci haven't been well interpreted and researchers mainly target pathogenic gene to find cure from the root. It is unnecessary to dream that a 'perfect Aryanne' will be produced by the Third Reich fascists. At last, any alterations in gene sequence increase the risk of mutation. For mutation is principally random, it will inevitably change the appearance of the newly cloned human.\n",
      "Given that the technology is still marching to maturity by now, there may be less ethical concerns. As gene-related research mainly focus on fatal diseases, the current application is to be therapeutic only. In addition, the true customers behind cloning are unconceivable couples and those who carry genetic diseases, not politicians with crazy ideas, as it is economically unfavorable. Updates in technology will enhance the potential of gene related therapies on traditional medicine resistant patients and bring new hope to them.\n",

Some people consider it as an opportunity while other people held a totally opposite opinion that it will certainly become a threat. Personally, I don't agree with either of them and I think it's Okay to clone animals or plants, but it's a threat when it comes to human beings.\n",
      "Farmers recently have adopted the technology to clone plants. For them, it's fantastic news that crops feature qualities that people like such as juiciness in tomatoes with the help of cloning, Scientists who study animals ever make it to clone the endangered animals to save them and the technology somehow has made up for our damages to their living environments.\n",
      "However, cloning between cloning human beings is never a good idea and should never be allowed. If human beings are cloned, our senses of uniqueness will be destroyed and our lives will be meaningless. Furthermore, if clones of us are used in crimes, results will be awful.\n",

      "Essay: The not so new technology of cloning about which many scientific novels and movies have already discussed, has never failed to arose infinite interest and imaginations. These often are too off-target that they become funny, which, as a result, means cloning is misunderstood. While my opinion is, a clear and scientific understanding of \"cloning\" is in must, and morally, only human cloning should be banned. \n",
      "What people must understand before deciding the fate of this controversial technology is that the perfect copy-and-pasting of a person is not possible. A person's personality is decided by his experience environment as much as his gene. This means a cloned human cannot represent the state of the original human, both physically and mentally. In such way, without the consciousness of oneself as a cloned organism, a cloned animal can live quite normally, he is a real animal after all, which is the reason why animal cloning is perfectly fine.\n",
      "However, the problems we face with cloned humans are shortened lives and self-consciousness. Just like Dolly the sheep, cloned animals suffer from below-average levels of physical well-being and shortened lifetime. While animals, when being cloned, always serve a certain function. Humans have the right to live independently, which means that deciding their physical health to be bad is unfair. Meanwhile, as cloned humans, almost certainly helped the chance and ability to realize their identity as a cloned organism. They will find it hard to accept feeling that they are just a copy of someone else. It's not the truth, though, but it's certainly morally wrong to make them suffer.\n",
