Why I am not an advocate of "green telenologies"Starting from 2016, the Paris Agreement has been urging its membership to lower their carbon emition to control the global temperature rise by 2. Even before then, thousands of groups had been working on various green technologies to tackle the problem of global warming. Some of them are promising solution, while others are no more than a hoax. advocates of these techs suggest that these technologies are the only way to a sustainable world and are worth the huge investments spent on them. Sadly. neither of the statements is part of the turth.Advocates of the green techs claimed that renewable energy sources can save us from the emitions from burning fossil fuels. That statement is ture. However, many other alternatives today are doing exactly the same thing while also seem to have a promising future. In the past decades, the efficiency of almost all the electrical devices has been improved greatly. Just yesterday, the US emergy department announced that the NIF, their experimental plant of nuclear fusion, had successfully output emergy. Nuclear fusion plants, together with the highly efficient energyconservation techs, also repersent another solution of the global warming.Meanwhile, the current green techs are never economically efficient. Much as its advocates might be pride of its low cost, the hydraulic and wind power are actually come from the nature and their resourcesareas which are rich of rivers or winds, are quite limited. The solar power, however, repersent another situation. There are sunshine everywhere on earth, but the cost for every solar panel is just much higher than traditional sources while also much higher than the price most countries can afford.To conclude, green techs are not somethings that makes no sense. However, with all these alternatives and the techs' high cost, it may not be a wise decision to put all our eggs in this single bucket.
