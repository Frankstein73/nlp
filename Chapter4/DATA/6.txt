In my view, cloning of plants and animals for economy or research about treating diseases, but human cloning should not be allowed. There are several reasons as follows:
To begin with, cloning does do some good to economical or scientific development. For instance, when there isn’t enough space to grow more crops because of the growing number of citizens, we need to create a more efficient kind of crops to replace the old one.  Also, scientists will be enabled to do more experiments in order to have a better understanding of the theories and conclusions with the technology of cloning, especially in biology and medicines.
Besides, it is definitely inappropriate and harmful to clone human beings. The new-born baby is likely to have some unknown diseases or lack of consciousness. Even if he is as healthy as a normal person, he doesn't have parents and personal identity, which is totally different from others. I think it will be extremely difficult for him even just to live an ordinary life, which is extremely unacceptable and upsetting.
All in all，reproductive cloning shouldn't be allowed, but cloning for economy or research is worth trying。
