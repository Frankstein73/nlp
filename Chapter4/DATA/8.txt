The not so new technology of cloning about which many scientific novels and mories have already discussed, has never failed to arose infinite interest and imaginations. These often are too off-target that they become funny, which, as a result, means cloning is misunderstood. While my opinion is, a clear and scientific understanding of “cloning” is in must, and morally, only human cloning should be banned. 
What people must understand before deciding the fate of this controversial technology is that the perfect copy-and-pasting of a person is not possible. A person's personality is decided by his experience environment as much as his gene. This means a cloned human cannot represent the state of the original human, both physically and mentally. In such way, without the consciousness of oneself as a cloned organism, a cloned animal can live quite normally, he is a real animal after all, which is the reason why animal cloning is perfectly fine.
However, the problems we face with cloned humans are shortened lives and self-consciousness. Just like Dolly the sheep, cloned animals suffer from below-average levels of physical well-being and shortened lifetime. While animals, when being cloned, always serve a certain function. Humans have the right to live independently, which means that deciding their physical health to be bad is unfair. Meanwhile, as cloned humans, almost certainly helped the chance and ability to realize their identity as a cloned organism. They will find it hard to accept feeling that they are just a copy of someone else. It's not the truth, though, but it's certainly morally wrong to make them suffer.
