How learning languages be critical for Chinese people Just a month ago, heated discussions emerged in the Chinese internet about second language education. A delegate's speech in the NPC led to the discussion. In the delegate's opinion learning English is not only a waste of time, but also it takes up the priceless chance for high school students to learn practical knowledges as physics and Chinese writing. However, English itself can be considered as practical knowledge in a globalized world. Today's China is contributing more to the world than any period in history. China's mass industry is providing essential products for the world's citizens, while its culture has been becoming more influencial. To be a global citizen, a Chinese should, at least, speak the world's language, which is currently English. Some might argue that most Chinese don't need to, and don't have chances to talk to foriegners. However, since 1978, China's foreign affair policies have always focused on opening up, and this trend continues. Americans don't have that trouble for their domestic language is English itself. However, learning a second language still helps them get to know more cultural patterns and thus expands their views of thinking. The same logic holds for Chinese people learning a third language, for they are typically considered good math learners, but not creative thinkers. We can see that both being billingual and being multilingual can help Chinese in distinctive ways. And I believe that language learning helps you be a better person, China a better country, and the globe a better world.
