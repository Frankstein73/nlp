From my perspective, cloning should be allowed fer research about treating diseases, but human cloning should not be allowed.
Diseases, have always been major cause of death, is an unavoidable issue from ancient world. However, as the technology continues to improve, treating diseases by cloning technology might help to cure decisive diseases effectively like never before. By applying a normal egg of the specific organ, the scientists can get a brand new part of human body and distribute that to patients.
However, it's hard to only copy a part of body with the help of the fertility of another creature. If the case turned out to be picking out a particular part of a cloned creature, the problem became severe morally. We clearly don't have the access to deprive an unborn creatureâ€™s body. In addition to this, the cloning of human bodies is risky which includes potential threats which includes potential threats which will bring pain to the cloned creatures.
Therefore, I don't agree with the coning of human beings.
