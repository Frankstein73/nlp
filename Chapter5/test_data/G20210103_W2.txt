Animal drug testan unnecessary approach? Suppose you are an animal right defender and you call for abolishing the medical tests on animals, you will find surprisingly that almost everyone in China relys on drugsparticularly vaccinesbased on animal test for living. Animal tests, as the most costefficient method of modern drug testing, still hold a unique place in the medical industry and can hardly be replaced. Served as cheap experiment tools, rodents and other manmals like pigs are commonly used in the primary stage of drugtesting. The aim of these tests are usually to ensure that the new compounds don't have significant sideeffects and is effective in some ways so that the pharmaceutical giants can move on to real test on patients. According to the FDA, most drugs in the US need to undergo animal tests before applied on human. "All our treatments have passed the animal test, including our COVID19 vaccine." says Zhang, a high manager of the Fuxin pharmacy, a medical giant in China. "We care about the safety of all our patient." The reason why animals have become so popular is that rodents are costefficient, while being accurate serving as a medical modal. The organism grows and reproduces fast and its organs are similar to that of human's in many ways. To perform an animal test, all you need is several coins in your pocket, while these alternative methods are much more expensive. It is unsurprising to see that many are against the test. As the Chinese scholar, Mengzi has said "One would become nonhuman without any thoughts of mercy." But the question is that animals are consumed everywhere in the society, not only in animal drug tests. For instance, far more animals are killed in the farming industry. If you can accept eating animal meat, why are you going against the animal testing?
