Ipads should not be blamed for rude videos Weeks before, some students in our school did some offensive behavior that hurted other studednts online using their ipads. I have heard rumors saying that students should be given the chance to get in touch with their ipads in school. However, I believed that ipads have given us so many conveniences and shouldn't be blamed for their "wrong behaviors". Firstly, some students have their own PCs and ipads. Banning them from ipads at school doesn't really stop them from accessing the internet. Also, even without the internet, some students might still say rude words offline. What we should do is to change these students' wrong behavior instead of finding an excuse for them. Second, imagine what an easy access to ipad has brought us here in classrooms since they were applied with Ebooks downloaded, we have found it much easier to search for needed data and documents online. The ipads are also more friendly to the teacher who can evalute the number of homeworks handed just by a click. These benefits will all gone with our ipads if we ban these expensive divices. To prevent the horrible incident pron happening again, it might be a better solution for us to ban some of the Apps or functions for students instead of giving up using the ipads.
