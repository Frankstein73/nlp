With scientists‘ joint efforts, the technology of cloning has emerged. Some people consider it as an opportunity while other people held a totally opposite opinion that it will certainly become a threat. Personally, I don't agree with either of them and I think it's Okay to clone animals or plants, but it's a threat when it comes to human beings.
Farmers recently have adopted the technology to clone plants. For them, it's fantastic news that crops feature qualities that people like such as juiciness in tomatoes with the help of cloning, Scientists who study animals ever make it to clone the endangered animals to save them and the technology somehow has made up for our damages to their living environments.
However, cloning between cloning human beings is never a good idea and should never be allowed. If human beings are cloned, our senses of uniqueness will be destroyed and our lives will be meaningless. Furthermore, if clones of us are used in crimes, results will be awful.
To sum up, cloning plants and animals enable us to have a better life, but cloning human beings is absolutely a threat that will potentially do harm to us.
